 Welcome to the world of C—a vigorous, professional programming language popular with 
amateur and commercial programmers alike. 

Dennis Ritchie of Bell Labs created C in 1972 as he and Ken Thompson worked on designing 
the Unix operating system. 

 C is oriented to fulfill the needs of programmers. 
 
 This flexibility is both an advantage and a danger. 
 
 C gives you more freedom, but  it also puts more responsibility on you.
 
   What Computers Do
   
   Now that you are about to learn how to program in C, you probably should know a little 
about how computers work.

This knowledge will help you understand the connection between 
writing a program in C and what eventually takes place when you run that program. 

 Modern computers have several components. 
 
 The  central processing unit , or  CPU , does most 
of the computing work. 

The  random access memory , or  RAM , serves as a workspace to hold 
programs and files. 


The permanent memory storage device, typically a hard disk in the past, 
but now more and more often a solid-state device, remembers those programs and files, even 
while the computer is turned off. 


And various peripherals—such as the keyboard, mouse, 
touchscreen, and monitor—provide for communication between the computer and you. 

The CPU processes your programs; so let’s concentrate on its role.
